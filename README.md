# newsfeed
Design a simple social network, including users and their posts. Users can follow each other and have a newsfeed to see those changes
There are only users, and users follow each other like a directed graph (no pages, groups...)
Information of a Post includes the person who posted it, the time it was posted, the content including text, images, and the likes/comments that a person says about it.
Information of a user includes name, username, password (encrypted) and list of people following and being followed.

Support function:
- Create an account and login, users can follow/unfollow others. Users have the right to edit personal information such as password and name.
- View a user's home page (including feeds and basic information)
- Newsfeed: view the feeds of the people you follow
- Interact with a feed: comment and like that comment
